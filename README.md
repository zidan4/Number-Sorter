# Platform-Game-in-JavaScript


freeCodeCamp Practice Project.


JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures.


Coding a game is a great way to grasp fundamental programming principles, while also creating an interactive gaming experience.

In this platformer game project, I continued to learn about classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation. I also learnt how to design and organize game elements efficiently and gain insights into problem-solving and code reusability.
